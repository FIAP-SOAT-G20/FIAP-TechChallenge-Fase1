- `bin`: directory to store compiled executable binary.
- `docs`: directory to store project's documentation, such as swagger static files.
- `cmd`: directory for main entry points or commands of the application. The http sub-directory holds the main HTTP server entry point.
- `internal`: directory for containing application code that should not exposed to external packages.
- `core`: directory that contains the central business logic of the application. Inside it there are 4 sub-directories.
- `domain`: directory that contains domain models/entities representing core business concepts.
- `port`: directory that contains defined interfaces or contracts that adapters must follow.
- `service`: directory that contains the business logic or services of the application.
- `util`: directory that contains utility functions that reused in the service package.
- `adapters`: directory for containing external services that will interact with the core of application. There are 4 external services used in this application.
- `handler/http`: directory that contains HTTP request and response handler.
- `repository/postgres`: directory that contains database adapters for PostgreSQL.
- `cache/redis`: directory that contains cache adapters for Redis.
- `token/paseto`: directory that contains token generation and validation adapters using Paseto.

### :pushpin: Decisions

TBD

- [x] Hexagonal architecture
- [x] PostgreSQL database
- [x] Conventional commits
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Code coverage

## :computer: Technologies

- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## :scroll: Requirements

### Build/Run with Docker

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Build/Run Locally

- [Go](https://golang.org/)

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have Go (> 1.18) installed in your machine to build, run and test the application locally

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## :cd: Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com/FIAP-SOAT-G20/FIAP-TechChallenge-Fase1.git
```

```sh
cd FIAP-TechChallenge-Fase1
```

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

### :whale: Docker

```sh
make compose-build
```

### :hammer: Build (build locally)

```sh
make build
```
> The binary will be created in the `bin` folder

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## :runner: Running

### :whale: Docker

```sh
make run-compose
```

### :hammer: Build (run locally)

```sh
make run
```

> [!NOTE]
> `make run` will run the application locally, and will build and run PostgreSQL container using Docker Compose

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## :white_check_mark: Tests

```sh
make test
```
> It will run the unit tests and generate the coverage report as `cp.out` and `coverage.html`
